Snippet Zone

This repository contains unsorted source code, and is used for experimentation purposes.

Codes are here and not somewhere else because of at least one of these reasons :
* They are highly unsafe, unsorted, undocumented, or feature incomplete
* They are too small to go into a dedicated repository
* They are currently not part of any useful project
* They are general purpose libraries / functions / API I'm using in multiple projects

All code here is free to use unless specified otherwise, but if you are using something from here in your projects, please be polite and tell me. I would be glad to know that you found something useful to you, and what changes you made to make it even better.
Thank you.
